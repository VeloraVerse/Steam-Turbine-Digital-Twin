# Digital Twin Concept

## What is a Digital Twin?

A Digital Twin is a virtual representation of a physical system that mirrors the behaviour of the real asset using data, models, and analytics.

Digital Twins are widely used in:

- Manufacturing
- Aerospace
- Power Generation
- Robotics
- Process Industries

## Application in Thermal Power Plants

For steam turbines, a digital twin can be used to:

- Estimate turbine performance
- Predict efficiency changes
- Monitor operational behaviour
- Support decision-making
- Detect abnormal conditions

## Implementation in this Project

In this project:

Inputs:

- Steam temperatures
- Steam pressures
- Feedwater parameters
- Coal flow
- Thermodynamic measurements

Outputs:

- Gross Load
- HP Turbine Efficiency
- NPHR
- NTHR

Machine learning models learn the relationship between operating conditions and performance indicators, thereby creating a simplified data-driven digital twin of the steam turbine system.

## Limitations

The current implementation is purely data-driven and does not incorporate first-principles thermodynamic equations or real-time plant integration.

Future work may combine machine learning with physics-based models to develop a more robust hybrid digital twin.
